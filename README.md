I enjoyed reading through this article, as it succinctly summarizes 
the duties of a SWE, and makes me realize I know nothing.

I found that a software engineer's day is multifaceted, encompassing coding, meetings, and peer collaboration. Whether working remotely or in an office, they often delve into their coding projects first thing, aiming to achieve a focused "mental flow" state conducive for problem-solving. Throughout the day, they may participate in meetings, review emails, and engage with colleagues on collaborative projects. Often, they consult with peers to address challenges in their work. By the afternoon, they might review and refine code, a regular and good practice, wrapping up their day typically between 5 and 6 p.m. The profession is as much about the technical aspect as it is about creativity, with many likening code creation to crafting poetry. The ability to problem-solve using the tools at their disposal is a fulfilling and essential part of their role.
